# This variable controls whether ws-security is enabled between
# eucalyptus components.  The default settings provide secure
# connections between the Cloud, Cluster, and Node Controllers and we
# recommend that this feature remains enabled.  If you wish to disable security,
# you must change this variable to "N" and manually configure the
# services.xml for both Cluster and Node Controllers (see documentation
# for more details).
ENABLE_WS_SECURITY="Y"

# This variable controls the level of logging output that appears in
# various eucalyptus log files.  The options are, in descending order
# of verbosity, 'DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and

# This is the port the Cluster Controller will be listening on.
CC_PORT="8774"

# This option configures the Cluster Controller's scheduling policy.
# Currently, this option can be set to GREEDY (first node that is
# found that can run the VM will be chosen), ROUNDROBIN (nodes are
# selected one after another until one is found that can run the VM),
# or POWERSAVE (nodes are put to sleep when they are not running VMs,
# and reawakened when new resources are required.  VMs will be placed
# on the first awake machine, followed by machines that are asleep).
#
#
#
# To use the rule based mapping approach, set this option to POLICYBASED
# and chose policy weights by setting POLICY_LOCALITY_WEIGHT, POLICY_PERFORMANCE_WEIGHT
# and POLICY_ENGERGYEFFICIENCY_WEIGHT. The rule based mapping approach has been
# integrated to the cluster controller only for now. 
#
# Additionally sensor commands for determineing node utilization, vm utilization, 
# network utilization and power consumption may be selected by 
# NETWORK_UTILIZATION_SENSOR_CMD, INSTANCE_UTILIZATION_SENSOR_CMD, 
# UTILIZATION_SENSOR_CMD and POWER_CONSUMPTION_SENSOR_CMD. All sensor commands
# have to write an integer value as measurement value to stdout. The 
# INSTANCE_UTILIZATION_SENSOR_CMD gets the instance id as command line argument.
#
# Setting the option USE_MONITORING_HISTORY effects the inspection of past measurement 
# data.
# 
# For using dynamic mapping, the option MIGRATION_EVENTS has to be set to 1 to enforce
# a check of a possible migration at shutting down instances. A dynamic mapping may
# also be invoked by SOAP call. Use the MigrateInstances operation, defined in 
# wsdl/eucalyptus_cc.wsdl for this. MAX_MIGRATE defines the maximum number of migrated 
# vms per SOAP call. Using dynamic mapping is experimental and demands manual instance
# cleanup.

####
# The following are options for image storage on the Node Controller
####

# This variable points to a directory which is used by the Node Controller
# to store images of running instances as well as local cached copies of
# images.  The running images will be deleted after the instance is
# terminated, but the cached copies will persist, subject to LRU cache
# replacement and the NC_CACHE_SIZE size limit, below.  So, this
# partition should be at least as big as the cache size (or the maximum
# space needed by all images, whichever is bigger) plus the maximum space
# needed by the maximum number of instances allowed on the node.
# This directory should be local to the Node Controller (as
# opposed to a NFS share) for performance reasons.
INSTANCE_PATH="not_configured"

# The maximum amount of disk space, in Megabytes, that Eucalyptus is

####
# The following are networking options
####

# The 2 variable  VNET_PRIVINTERFACE and VNET_PUBINTERFACE specify the
# local physical ethernet interfaces that eucalyptus should use to manage
# the VM network.  On the front-end, VNET_PRIVINTERFACE should be set to
# the device that is attached to the same ethernet network as your nodes.
# - VNET_PUBINTERFACE should be set to the device which is connected to
# the 'public' network.  If you have only one interface, these should
# be set to the same value.  On the nodes, both should be set to
# either the name of the bridge that has been set up by Xen (xenbr0,
# eth0, etc), or the physical ethernet device that is attached to the
# xen bridge (peth0, peth1, etc), depending on your xen configuration.
VNET_PUBINTERFACE="eth0"
VNET_PRIVINTERFACE="eth0"

# (node setting only) VNET_BRIDGE should be set to the name of the
# bridge that xen has configured.  This is typically named 'xenbr0,
# xenbr1, etc' on older Xen versions, and 'eth0, eth1, etc' on newer
# Xen versions.  The command 'brctl show' will give you more
# information on your local bridge setup.
VNET_BRIDGE="xenbr0"

# This indicates where we have a dhcp server binary. We use it to provide
# the images with IPs: Eucalyptus provides its own configuration per
# instance. 
VNET_DHCPDAEMON="/usr/sbin/dhcpd"

# Some systems have their DHCP daemon configured to run as a non-root
# user.  If this is the case, set the name of that user here (by
# default, Eucalyptus will set up DHCPD configuration files and
# directories as owned by root).
#VNET_DHCPUSER="root"

# Following are example eucalyptus VM networking configurations.
# There are four modes to choose from (MANAGED, MANAGED-NOVLAN,
# SYSTEM, or STATIC) and each has its own sub-options.  The first
# modes (MANAGED, MANAGED-NOVLAN) configure eucalyptus to fully manage
# the VM networks, and enables the ability to use security groups and
# dynamic public IP assignment (with and without vlan tagging of
# security group networks, respectively).  VNET_SUBNET should be set
# to an IP subnet that is free for eucalyptus to use (i.e. no other
# system connected to your network directly is configured with
# addresses from this subnet).  VNET_NETMASK defines the size of the
# subnet.  VNET_DNS should be set to a DNS server that your systems
# use (usually safe to use the same DNS that is configured on the
# front-end).  VNET_ADDRSPERNET can be used to limit the number of
# instances that can be attached to each named security group
# simultaneously.  Finally, VNET_PUBLICIPS should be set to any public
# IPs, that are currently unused, that can be dynamically assigned to
# VMs.  Of these options, only VNET_PUBLICIPS can be left blank or
# undefined.  If you are running in multi-cluster mode (more than one
# CC), you should uncomment VNET_LOCALIP and set it to the local IP of
# the CC that is accessible by all other CCs in the system.  If
# VNET_LOCALIP is unset, the CC will try to determine the list of all
# IPs currently assigned to the machine at CC run time.  If your CC
# and CLC are on different machines, uncomment VNET_CLOUDIP and set it
# to your cloud-contoller's IP address (must be an address that can be
# reached by the CC).

#VNET_MODE="MANAGED"
#VNET_SUBNET="192.168.0.0"
#VNET_NETMASK="255.255.0.0"

#VNET_LOCALIP="your-public-interface's-ip"
#VNET_CLOUDIP="your-cloud-controller's-ip"

# If you would like eucalyptus to not manage the VM network at all,
# you can set VNET_MODE to SYSTEM.  In this mode, VM interfaces are
# attached directly to your physical ethernet, at which point they
# will typically invoke a DHCP client to aquire an IP address.  Use
# this mode if you wish to manage VM IPs yourself, or allow the VMs to
# pick up an IP from a non-eucalyptus managed DHCP server.
VNET_MODE="SYSTEM"

# If VNET_MODE is set to STATIC, you can manually configure a set of
# IP addresses that will be allocated to VMs at boot time in a first
# come, first served manner.  VNET_SUBNET, VNET_NETMASK, and
# VNET_BROADCAST define your subnet (front-end must have an interface
# configured on this subnet).  VNET_ROUTER defines the subnet's
# gateway.  VNET_DNS is a nameserver address.  It is usually safe to
# get these settings by examining your front-end network settings and
# duplicating them here.  VNET_MACMAP is a list of mac address/IP
# address mappings that you would like to be allocated to VMs at run
# time (see example below for the format of this list).
#VNET_MODE="STATIC"
#VNET_SUBNET="192.168.1.0"
